  * Use dh_python2 instead of pycentral for Debian >= squeeze and Ubuntu >=

  * python/pythontest2.py: With Python 2.7, gc.collect() doesn't always
    collect all the garbage, so repeat until no further objects are
    freed.  (Closes: #625679)
  * ruby/smoketest.rb: Older Ruby 1.8.x doesn't have Dir.mktmpdir() -
    just skip the compaction tests for these versions.

  * debian/rules: Do all building under debian/build so we can clean up with a
    single call to "rm -rf".
  * debian/rules,debian/control.in,debian/control-ruby.in: Build packages for
    Ruby 1.9.1 where appropriate.

    there.
  * debian/rules: Include DH_PYCENTRAL=include-links change from Ubuntu - this
    means that the package is immediately useful when installed or upgraded.
    The downside is that the package needs a rebuild when the list of Python
    versions changes, but that's much less frequent than new Xapian packages.

xapian-bindings (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/copyright: Update for 2008 and a few other minor changes.
  * debian/rules: The dependency on libxapianN is now versioned.  We require a
    version >= the version of xapian-bindings being packaged (which is
    sometimes slightly too conservative, but simple to implement without
    manual maintenance).  Closes: #462106
  * debian/rules: Add support for parallel=<n> in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, as
    recommended by policy 3.8.0.  Use $(filter ...) instead of $(find ...)
    to check for noopt in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to avoid false matches on
    substrings of non-standard options (e.g. snooptables).  Add support
    for nocheck in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * debian/control.in: Standards-Version: 3.8.0
  * debian/watch: Add watch file.  Not useful for me as I make the upstream
    releases, but DEHS, etc find it useful.
  * debian/control.in: Capitalise python to placate lintian.
  * debian/patch: Remove since all patches are already in the upstream
    sources.
  * debian/rules: Calculate the version starting the next release branch (so
    1.1.0 currently) and use that as the upper bound on the libxapian-dev
    build dependency).
  * debian/tclxapian.install: Update to reflect new install location which
    reflects the new tcl policy: /usr/lib/xapian<version> ->
    /usr/lib/tcltk/xapian<version>
  * debian/rules: Tweak how we build the conflicts/replaces for old
    python-xapian as the old way doesn't seem to work for newer versions of
    GNU make.
  * debian/rules: Force link_all_deplibs=no so libtool doesn't try to
    explicitly link with -lz.

  * php4-xapian and php5-xapian now make use of the (relatively) new
    /etc/phpN/conf.d mechanism to enable the xapian extension automatically,
    instead of modifying php.ini directly (after checking that's OK using
    debconf).  Backports to Debian oldstable, and to Ubuntu etch and earlier,
    now require the user to add "extension=xapian.so" to php.ini by hand,
    so backports where this is required now include a README.Debian which
    explains this.
  * debian/rules: Upstream build now generates .pyo so we need to tell
    dh_install that we don't want to package it.

    as the values we explicitly set are the defaults anyway (and we don't

  * debian/rules: Upstream no longer support Python 2.1 bindings so update
    comments regarding the Python versions supported by the sarge backport.
  * debian/control.in,debian/control-php.in: Add "Suggests: xapian-doc" since

    lightweight test but will at least ensure that the basics work.  It also
    serves to check the core library is working - xapian-core's own testsuite
    is probably too slow to justify devoting autobuilder time to.

  * We no longer need to change the permissions of xapian.py and xapian.pyc

  * Add "python" to "Build-Depends" so that dh_python works and also to
    workaround a broken configure test for PYTHON_PATHSEP which uses "python"

xapian-bindings (0.9.5-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * PHP bindings packages now have the correct "Depends:" and are able to
    automatically modify php.ini upon installation (using debconf to ask if
    this should be done) and removal.
  * dh_python automatically generates the xapian-python->xapian-python2.X
    dependency for us, so remove the PYTHON_VERSION_MAIN mechanism (which
    wasn't actually being used anyway!)
