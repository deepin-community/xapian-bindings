xapian-bindings (1.4.18-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release.
  * Add support for packaging perl bindings.  This is disabled by default
    since for Xapian 1.4.x the perl bindings here are still flagged as
    experimental and Search::Xapian (packaged separately) is the stable
    option.
  * debian/php7-xapian.postinst: Enable the module on first install.
    Reported by sylock.
  * debian/rules: Drop workaround for long-fixed bug in the PHP7 bindings
    (comment notes "Can be dropped once 1.4.5 is released and packaged"!)
  * debian/rules: Stop telling pyversions/py3versions to check debian/control
    since we aren't specifying X-Python-Version/X-Python3-Version there
    anyway, and the check has to be hacked around when generating
    debian/control in a clean tree.  Thanks due to Gaurav Arora.
  * debian/control.in: Mark conformance with policy 4.5.1.
  * Update to debhelper compat level 12.

xapian-bindings (1.2.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Build against tcl 8.5 in experimental.  (Closes: #582217)
  * debian/rules: Set TCLSH=/usr/bin/tclsh-default to make sure we use the
    default version of tclsh even if another version is installed and the
    preferred alternative.  Reported by Jonathan Nieder as a secondary issue in
    #582217.

xapian-bindings (1.2.0-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Removing the call to autoreconf means we need libxapian-dev >= 1.2.0-2.
  * Update to require dh7 and use dh compact level 7.
  * Switch to dpkg-source 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Drop unused build-dependency on po-debconf.
  * Drop version from Python dependency - even etch and dapper have a new
    enough Python.  Drop out-dated fallback if pyversions isn't installed.

    + Drop php5-xapian packages due to licence incompatibility.
      (Closes: #513796)
  * debian/control.in: Add missing build-dependencies: autoconf, automake-1.10,
    and libtool.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Sun, 25 Apr 2010 06:56:27 +0000

xapian-bindings (1.1.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * Drop support for unsupported Debian and Ubuntu releases, and also Ubuntu
    dapper.
  * debian/python-xapian.install: The xapian packages are now generated in a
    subdirectory, so update the paths accordingly, and include the .pth file.
  * debian/rules: Do all building under debian/build so we can clean up with a
    single call to "rm -rf".
  * debian/rules,debian/control.in,debian/control-ruby.in: Build packages for
    Ruby 1.9.1 where appropriate.
  * debian/rules: Run autoreconf to pick up Debian's patched libtool.
  * Drop conflicts on versioned python packages (e.g. python2.4-xapian) as
    these packages were phased out before etch.

xapian-bindings (1.0.19-1) unstable; urgency=low

    + Remove "DM-Upload-Allowed: yes" as I'm now a DD.
    + Add "Vcs-Browser:" and "Vcs-svn:".
    + Standards-Version: 3.8.4 (no changes required).
  * debian/rules: Update licence boilerplate from GPLv2+ to MIT/X.
  * debian/etc-php-conf.d-xapian.ini: Use ';' for comment instead of '#' as
    PHP 5.3 deprecates the latter.
  * Register the documentation for each language with doc-base.

xapian-bindings (1.0.16-2) unstable; urgency=low

xapian-bindings (1.0.15-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix typo in package descriptions.
  * debian/control.in: Standards-Version: 3.8.3 (no changes required).

xapian-bindings (1.0.14-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control.in: Standards-Version: 3.8.2 (no changes required).
  * debian/control.in: Drop the "www." from the homepage URL for consistency
    with upstream use.
  * debian/rules: Enable php5 bindings for hurd-i386 as php5 has now built
    there.
  * debian/rules: Include DH_PYCENTRAL=include-links change from Ubuntu - this
    means that the package is immediately useful when installed or upgraded.
    The downside is that the package needs a rebuild when the list of Python
    versions changes, but that's much less frequent than new Xapian packages.
  * debian/control.in: Update required debhelper version for Debian sarge and
    Ubuntu dapper.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Thu, 30 Jul 2009 03:45:53 +0100

xapian-bindings (1.0.13-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Don't allow CODENAME to be set in the environment.
  * Relicense the Debian packaging under the MIT/X licence.

xapian-bindings (1.0.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/copyright: Update for 2009 (and 2008 for the code in java/).
    /usr/share/common-licenses/GPL -> /usr/share/licenses/GPL-2 since the
    former is now a symlink to GPL-3 and Xapian is GPL v2 or later.
  * debian/python-xapian.install: Look for files to install in "*-packages"
    instead of "site-packages" as Ubuntu jaunty's Python 2.6 installs packaged
    extensions in dist-packages instead.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Sun,  3 May 2009 10:56:17 +0100

xapian-bindings (1.0.12-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.

  * debian/control.in,debian/control-php.in: Update sections of php5-xapian
    and libxapian-ruby1.8.
  * debian/compat: Increase from 4 to 5 since 4 is now deprecated in sid and
    5 is supported by all currently supported Debian and Ubuntu releases.

xapian-bindings (1.0.10-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * ACK NMU - thanks Chris!
    - Bug #506090 fixed upstream in 1.0.10 so NMU patch no longer required.
  * New upstream release.
  * debian/control.in: Add "DM-Upload-Allowed: yes" since I'm now a Debian
    Maintainer.

xapian-bindings (1.0.7-3.1) unstable; urgency=medium

    clean target. (Closes: #506090)

 -- Chris Lamb <lamby@debian.org>  Tue, 18 Nov 2008 19:32:24 +0000

xapian-bindings (1.0.7-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Install /etc/php5/conf.d/xapian.ini instead of /etc/php5/conf.d/xapian as
    the file is ignored unless it has extensions ".ini".  Closes: #493941
  * Install xapian.php in /usr/share/php not /usr/share/php5 so that it is in
    the default PHP include_path.  Closes: #493944
  * debian/rules: Run "make all" and "make check" as separate commands to
    avoid hitting parallel building bugs.  Closes: #494247

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Fri,  8 Aug 2008 08:18:52 +0100

xapian-bindings (1.0.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Fix build rule to be parallel make safe.
  * debian/rules: Back out link_all_deplibs=no change made in 1.0.7-1 since
    the bindings shared objects weren't getting an explicit dependency on zlib
    anyway.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Tue, 29 Jul 2008 15:25:56 +0100

xapian-bindings (1.0.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * debian/copyright: Update for 2008 and a few other minor changes.
  * debian/rules: The dependency on libxapianN is now versioned.  We require a
    version >= the version of xapian-bindings being packaged (which is
    sometimes slightly too conservative, but simple to implement without
    manual maintenance).  Closes: #462106
  * debian/rules: Add support for parallel=<n> in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, as
    recommended by policy 3.8.0.  Use $(filter ...) instead of $(find ...)
    to check for noopt in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS to avoid false matches on
    substrings of non-standard options (e.g. snooptables).  Add support
    for nocheck in DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS.
  * debian/control.in: Standards-Version: 3.8.0
  * debian/watch: Add watch file.  Not useful for me as I make the upstream
    releases, but DEHS, etc find it useful.
  * debian/control.in: Capitalise python to placate lintian.
  * debian/patch: Remove since all patches are already in the upstream
    sources.
  * debian/rules: Calculate the version starting the next release branch (so
    1.1.0 currently) and use that as the upper bound on the libxapian-dev
    build dependency).
  * debian/tclxapian.install: Update to reflect new install location which
    reflects the new tcl policy: /usr/lib/xapian<version> ->
    /usr/lib/tcltk/xapian<version>
  * debian/rules: Tweak how we build the conflicts/replaces for old
    python-xapian as the old way doesn't seem to work for newer versions of
    GNU make.
  * debian/rules: Force link_all_deplibs=no so libtool doesn't try to
    explicitly link with -lz.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Sat, 26 Jul 2008 16:27:57 +0100

xapian-bindings (1.0.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Look for "CODENAME" and "debian/codename" rather than
    "COMPONENT" and "debian/component".
  * debian/rules: Strip out unused support for Ubuntu breezy since it reached
    end-of-life and we stopped building packages for it a while ago.
  * debian/control.in: Standards-Version: 3.7.3 (no changes required).
  * debian/patch: Remove patch for building tcl8 on latest sid as it is
    already in the upstream sources.
  * debian/patch: Add patch to fix installation of Ruby RDocs.
  * debian/patch: Add patch to fix "make check" for PHP4 (needed for some of
    the backports).
  * debian/libxapian-ruby1.8.install: Package the installed RDocs.
  * debian/control.in,debian/control-php.in: The "Homepage:" header is now
    official, so convert "Homepage:" pseudo-headers.
  * debian/rules: For Debian lenny and later, and Ubuntu hardy and later,
    make use of the new tcl and tcl-dev packages as the Debian Tcl/Tk policy
    describes.

  * debian/rules: Override RUBY_LIB and RUBY_LIB_ARCH which now have different
    defaults upstream.
  * debian/patch: Backport configure fix from upstream SVN to allow tcl8 to be
    built on unstable.
  * debian/tclxapian.install: Also package "usr/share/tcltk/xapian*" which is
    where files get installed on unstable.
  * debian/php4-xapian.install,debian/php5-xapian.install,
    debian/python-xapian.install,debian/libxapian-ruby1.8.install,
    debian/tclxapian.install: Update for "bindings.html" -> "index.html"

xapian-bindings (1.0.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

xapian-bindings (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * php4-xapian and php5-xapian now make use of the (relatively) new
    /etc/phpN/conf.d mechanism to enable the xapian extension automatically,
    instead of modifying php.ini directly (after checking that's OK using
    debconf).  Backports to Debian oldstable, and to Ubuntu etch and earlier,
    now require the user to add "extension=xapian.so" to php.ini by hand,
    so backports where this is required now include a README.Debian which
    explains this.
  * debian/rules: Upstream build now generates .pyo so we need to tell
    dh_install that we don't want to package it.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Tue, 12 Jun 2007 02:21:14 +0100

xapian-bindings (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * New debconf translations:
    - Malayalam.  Closes: #418032
    - Dutch.  Closes: #423066
  * debian/rules: Debian unstable has dropped PHP4 support, so don't build
    php4-xapian for it.  Closes: #424809
  * debian/rules,debian/php4-xapian.install,debian/php5-install: Install and
    package xapian.php which is handy for PHP4 and vital for PHP5.
  * debian/rules: Update now there's a new stable release.  Keep support for
    oldstable for the time being, in case someone wants to backport.
  * debian/patch: Changes included upstream so remove.
  * debian/patch: Add new patches to fix "package require xapian" issues for
    Tcl example scripts.
  * debian/copyright: Update.
  * debian/rules: We don't need to pass --mandir or --infodir to configure
    as the values we explicitly set are the defaults anyway (and we don't
    have any documentation in "info" format).
  * debian/rules: Avoid Lintian's uses-dh-python-with-no-pycompat warning -
    for now we want to keep the call to dh_python for backports.

xapian-bindings (0.9.9-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Fix how we determine the phpapi version to depend on.
    The previous way was technically wrong, but got the right answer
    for Debian unstable, and for Ubuntu dapper and edgy (Debian sarge was
    wrong though).
  * debian/po/nb.po: New debconf translation from Hans Fredrik Nordhaug
    (Closes: #414461).

    a bit of diskspace and time during the build.
  * debian/rules: Fix the incorrect "Conflicts:" and "Replaces:" we generate
    for the old "per-version" Python packages (broken in 0.9.8-1).
  * debian/patch: Patch to fix building bindings for Python 2.5 on amd64

  * debian/rules: Add no-op "binary-indep" target (Closes: #395761).
  * debian/rules: Don't try to build PHP bindings on hurd-i386 (PHP hasn't
    been ported, but Python, Tcl, and Ruby have).
  * debian/rules: Upstream no longer support Python 2.1 bindings so update
    comments regarding the Python versions supported by the sarge backport.
  * debian/control.in,debian/control-php.in: Add "Suggests: xapian-doc" since
    the xapian-core documentation is useful reading for people developing
    using xapian-bindings.
  * debian/rules: Use python-all-dev where we can.

 -- Olly Betts <olly@survex.com>  Sat,  4 Nov 2006 22:02:05 +0000

xapian-bindings (0.9.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control.in,debian/rules: Build dependency on libxapian-dev

  * debian/rules: Don't include Python 2.1 support in the stable backport
    since SWIG generates bad code for it at present.

xapian-bindings (0.9.7-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/rules: Fix typo in configure invocation for Tcl so that we only
    build the Tcl bindings in that source tree.
  * debian/rules: Build-Depends on phpN-cli so that we can run "make check".
  * debian/po/: Added newly translated debconf messages for fr, cs, pt, sv
    (Closes: #380341, #382933, #383396, #387533).

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/copyright: Add Java bindings copyrights and licences.
  * debian/rules: Run "make check" on each of the built bindings.  It's a very
    lightweight test but will at least ensure that the basics work.  It also
    serves to check the core library is working - xapian-core's own testsuite
    is probably too slow to justify devoting autobuilder time to.
  * debian/control.in,debian/control-php.in: Remove "designed to be" from the
    package description at Wookey's suggestion.

xapian-bindings (0.9.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * "Standards-Version: 3.7.2" - no changes required.
  * Debian unstable no longer includes Python 2.1 or 2.2, so don't package
    Python bindings for them (backports can easily reenable them.)
  * Add packages for the TCL bindings (which should work with any Tcl version
    from 8.1 onwards.)
  * We no longer need to change the permissions of xapian.py and xapian.pyc
    as they are now set correctly by the upstream "make install".
  * Add "python" to "Build-Depends" so that dh_python works and also to
    workaround a broken configure test for PYTHON_PATHSEP which uses "python"
    instead of "$PYTHON" so PYTHON_PATHSEP is empty if there's no "python"
    in the path.

  * PHP bindings packages now have the correct "Depends:" and are able to
    automatically modify php.ini upon installation (using debconf to ask if
    this should be done) and removal.
  * dh_python automatically generates the xapian-python->xapian-python2.X
    dependency for us, so remove the PYTHON_VERSION_MAIN mechanism (which
    wasn't actually being used anyway!)
